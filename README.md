A work-in-progress Python project for a CS board game tournament.

## Description

This project is a Python implementation of a game designed for a Computer Science board game tournament. The specific rules and gameplay are still evolving (and the code is a bit messy right now!), but the goal is to create a fun and engaging game using Python.

**Note:** This project is under active development and refactoring. The code may not be the most elegant at the moment, but I'm working on improving it!

## Features (Planned/In Progress)

*   Leaderboard Tracking: Keeps track of player scores and rankings.
*   Game Logic: Implements the core rules of the game.

## Contributing

I'm open to suggestions and contributions! However, please be aware that the project is currently undergoing significant refactoring. If you have ideas, feel free to open an issue to discuss them before submitting a pull request.
