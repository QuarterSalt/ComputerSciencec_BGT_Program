# ComputerSciencec_BGT_Program

A work-in-progress Python project for a CS board game tournament.

## Description

This project is a Python implementation of a game designed for a Computer Science board game tournament. The specific rules and gameplay are still evolving (and the code is a bit messy right now!), but the goal is to create a fun and engaging game using Python.

**Note:** This project is under active development and refactoring. The code may not be the most elegant at the moment, but I'm working on improving it!

## Features (Planned/In Progress)

*   Leaderboard Tracking: Keeps track of player scores and rankings.
*   Game Logic: Implements the core rules of the game (which are still being finalized).
*   [Add other planned features here as you develop them]

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/QuarterSalt/ComputerSciencec_BGT_Program.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```
    cd ComputerSciencec_BGT_Program
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies (if any):**
    ```
    pip install any_dependencies_you_need
    ```

4.  **Run the main script:**

    ```
    python main.py  # Or whatever the main script is called
    ```

## Project Structure

*   `main.py`: The main entry point of the program (subject to change!).
*   `[Other files]`: [Briefly describe what other files do, even if they are redundant. This shows you understand the codebase.]

## Contributing

I'm open to suggestions and contributions! However, please be aware that the project is currently undergoing significant refactoring. If you have ideas, feel free to open an issue to discuss them before submitting a pull request.

## Current Status

Actively refactoring and improving the code. The goal is to:

*   Reduce code duplication.
*   Improve code readability and maintainability.
*   Implement a more robust and well-defined game logic.
